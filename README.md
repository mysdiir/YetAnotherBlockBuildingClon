# Yet another block building clone

## What is it about?

Well, while preparing for my final exam I started playing Minecraft,just to clear my mind and find a little relaxation. But then some strange thought came into my mind: How does Minecraft work? 
And there it was: the itching feeling in my fingers and so was born the idea to recreate Minecraft for myself.

This repo will won't contain the final game as a playable version, moresoever this is a little blog where I write down my progress of creating it.
Have fun while reading ;)
