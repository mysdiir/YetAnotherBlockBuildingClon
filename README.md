# Yet another block building clone

## What is it about?

Well, while preparing for my final exam I started playing Minecraft,just to clear my mind and find a little relaxation. But then some strange thought came into my mind: How does Minecraft work? 
And there it was: the itching feeling in my fingers and so was born the idea to recreate Minecraft for myself.

This repo will won't contain the final game as a playable version, moresoever this is a little blog where I write down my progress of creating it.
Have fun while reading ;)

## Map generation
### Creating a hightmap

```Java
public class NoiseGenerator {
  private final int WIDTH = 600;
  private final int HEIGHT = 600;
  
  private int[][] coordinates = new int[WIDTH][HEIGHT];
  
  public void generateNoise(int width, int height) {
    
    for (int x = 0; x < coordinates[][].length; x++) {
      for (int y = 0; y < coordinates[][].length; y++) {
        
      }
    }
    
  }
}
```
